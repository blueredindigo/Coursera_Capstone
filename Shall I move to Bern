I'm currently living in a city called Lausanne, but there may be more job and life opportunities in another city called Bern. Bern is very popular among biotech and pharmaceutical companies and I want to use data science to help me decide which city would suit me best to live.\nI want to compare the livability of the two cities through using similar methods that have been used in the assignments from this course, and help me decide which area would be best for me to live. \nIn this project, I will use Foursquare data to compare the most interesting regions of Lausanne and Bern. This will be done with k-means to segment and cluster related neighbourhoods to allow me to estimate the suitable demographic to live there. I will be interested in areas which are suitable for a young adult demographic which would include social venues and public transport access.\nThe use of folium interactive maps would be very useful here also so I can visually see attractive features like rivers and parks in the respective areas. \n\n## Question to answer\nCompare Lausanne and Bern, and using data science techniques determine which neighbourhood would be best for me and why"
